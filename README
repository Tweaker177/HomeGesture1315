A simple tweak bringing the iPhone X and iPad style swipe gestures to older devices (like the iPhone 7/ 7+) that would otherwise use a home button.  The home button still works, but this tweak could be a lifesaver if it ever broke.  Tweak tested from iOS 13-15.7.2 for all jailbroken devices.

All you need is a screen to control where you want to go- swipe down from top right? Control Center..  Swipe up, unlock device, swipe up and slide to the left or right? Invoke the App Switcher, starting the Dosido animation.
